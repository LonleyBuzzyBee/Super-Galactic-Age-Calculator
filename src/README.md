- the class user object then gets put into the first sort funtion within the prototype

- the sort function determines which planetary age they selected if the planet they choose was mercury then it divides the users year by .24, if its venus then it divides the users year by .62, if it was mars then it mutiplies the users year by 1.88,if it was jupiter then it multiplie the users year by 11.86, then passes them into the next function
