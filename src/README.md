Take a person’s age in years and create a class that does the following:

Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. You can determine average life expectancy as you see fit. A simple way to do this would be to have the user input the average life expectancy for their demographic. A more involved way to do this would be to collect other information from the user (e.g. lifestyle, country of residence, activity level, etc.) to determine their life expectancy.
If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.


- the program takes the users input from a form taking in the users age, and which movie in the selected options is their fav and which selected option to choose for the age in which planetary years 

- the program takes the input and stores it in ageinput object as properties

- the class user object then gets put into the first sort funtion within the prototype

- the sort function determines which planetary age they selected if the planet they choose was mercury then it divides the users year by .24, if its venus then it divides the users year by .62, if it was mars then it mutiplies the users year by 1.88,if it was jupiter then it multiplie the users year by 11.86, then passes them into the next function




-  next function then determines which movie the user choose and either adds or subtracts from the age 

- the users input is then printed onto the html
